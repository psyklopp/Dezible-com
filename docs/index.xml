    <description>It is hard to focus - and there is lot to learn. Cybersecurity is a very broad field. Broader than what people might imagine.&#xA;There is a lot of data/information out there. It takes time to transform that to knowledge.&#xA;Sharing your learning progress can be an effective way to do it. My goal is to document and share my progress.&#xA;Hopefully it helps you.&#xA;What is next ? Soon, I will start adding content.</description>
