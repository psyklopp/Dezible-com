    <description>Hello! My name is Aditya Bhardwaj.&#xA;I passed out in July 2024 with an MSc. degree in Cybersecurity.&#xA;I have a goal - to just stick to it. While I learned a lot of things in my studies, I didn’t focus on the real-world tools.&#xA;This is a common issue. Often termed as ‘skill gap’.&#xA;It is hard to focus - and there is lot to learn. Cybersecurity is a very broad field.</description>
