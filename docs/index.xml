    <description>Welcome to Dezible.&#xA;Read the interesting experiment below or check out the basics of XAI starting here.&#xA;Experiment In 2018, hundreds of top computer scientists, financial engineers, and executives - were asked to engage in a thought experiment where they had cancer and needed surgery to remove a tumor.&#xA;Two images were displayed on the screen.&#xA;First image Human surgeon, who could explain anything about the surgery, but had a 15% chance of causing death during the surgery.</description>

      <description>For this section, I will refer to an excellent article published in 2020. It has reviewed concepts related to explainability of AI methods, discussed some transparent models and built a taxonomy based on the reviewed literature.&#xA;✒️ You can read the whole paper here Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI): Concepts, taxonomies, opportunities and challenges toward responsible AI https://doi.org/10.1016/j.inffus.2019.12.012.</description>

      <description>And why do I want to talk about this topic?&#xA;My name is Aditya Bhardwaj and am currently a PhD candidate at University of Twente - you can find me here through LinkedIn profile&#xA;I am deeply interested in following the progress in the area of XAI, specially in the methods of evaluating such XAI models.&#xA;And as I am starting to go through academic research for my PhD, I realized that there is a lack of systemized knowledge on XAI. There might a lot of resources on this topic, but are present sparsely.</description>
