    <description>Logs provide a detailed, chronological record of events which is necessary to investigate security incidents.&#xA;Without data flowing in, there is nothing to look at!&#xA;Security analysts make use of data from different sources - network traffic logs, host-based data (think of system logs) as well as threat intelligence to triage such security incidents.&#xA;PCAP Understanding and analyzing packet-level evidence in pcap files.&#xA;Details Work in progress.</description>

      <description>If you’re getting into cybersecurity or incident response, you’ll inevitably hear: “Check the packet capture.” But what does that actually mean?&#xA;Packet Capture or PCAP files record the raw data packets.&#xA;With the network activity stored in these files, we can investigate and anaylze traffic at the packet level. This helps in troubleshooting network issues besides investigating suspicious behaviour.&#xA;What is a PCAP file? Packet Capture or simply PCAP is basically a recording of everything that happened on a network. Think of it like a black box recorder for network traffic.</description>
