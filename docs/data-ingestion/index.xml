    <description>Logs provide a detailed, chronological record of events which is necessary to investigate security incidents.&#xA;Without data flowing in, there is nothing to look at!&#xA;PCAP Understanding and analyzing packet-level evidence in pcap files.&#xA;Details Work in progress.</description>

      <description>Packet Capture or PCAP files record the raw data packets. You can use tools like Wireshark and tcpdump to intercept data from a network interface, which are then stored as pcap files.&#xA;With the network activity stored in these files, we can investigate and anaylze traffic at the packet level.&#xA;Sample PCAP files We can generate our own traffic, but there are free, publicly available pcap files like here: Netresec 1&#xA;Details Work in progress.</description>
