    <title>Motivation - Dezible</title>
    <link>http://localhost:1313/motivation/</link>
    <description>My name is Aditya Bhardwaj and am currently a PhD candidate at University of Twente - you can find me here through LinkedIn profile&#xA;As the area of AI progresses, a number of people are sharing tutorials (about agents, LLMs and whatnot). Often times, these are singular projects which end up with others in project graveyard.&#xA;I want to change that.&#xA;My aim is to stick to some projects and build them incrementally. This way, I get to learn and apply new concepts.</description>
