    <title>eXplainable AI - Dezible</title>
    <link>https://dezible.com/basics/</link>
    <description>For this section, I will refer to an excellent article published in 2020. It has reviewed concepts related to explainability of AI methods, discussed some transparent models and built a taxonomy based on the reviewed literature.&#xA;✒️ You can read the whole paper here Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI): Concepts, taxonomies, opportunities and challenges toward responsible AI https://doi.org/10.1016/j.inffus.2019.12.012.</description>

      <description>The sophistication of AI-powered systems have increased exponentially in the last decade. And yet, you can (almost) design and deployment whole AI models without any human intervention.&#xA;I came across the experiment I shared on home page when I was reading an article titled:&#xA;Why Are We Using Black Box Models in AI When We Don’t Need To? A Lesson From an Explainable AI Competition&#xA;We are employing Machine Learning (ML) in more critical areas than ever. Hence it is natural to demand transparency in the decision-making process inside such models.</description>
