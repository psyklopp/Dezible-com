    <description>And why do I want to talk about this topic?&#xA;My name is Aditya Bhardwaj and am currently a PhD candidate at University of Twente - you can find me here through LinkedIn profile&#xA;I am deeply interested in following the progress in the area of XAI, specially in the methods of evaluating such XAI models.&#xA;And as I am starting to go through academic research for my PhD, I realized that there is a lack of systemized knowledge on XAI. There might a lot of resources on this topic, but are present sparsely.</description>
