This helps in troubleshooting network issues besides investigating suspicious behaviour.\nWhat is a PCAP file? Packet Capture or simply PCAP is basically a recording of everything that happened on a network. Think of it like a black box recorder for network traffic.\nIt acts like your ground truth. It shows exactly what data moved where, who talked to whom, and what protocols were used.\nFor security work, PCAPs are essential for:\nIncident response - reconstructing what an attacker actually did Threat hunting - looking for suspicious patterns in normal traffic Forensics - having evidence of what occurred Understanding attacks - seeing how exploits work at the network level How to capture network traffic? On Linux, you will need just a few tools to get started:\ntcpdump - The command-line packet capture tool. It‚Äôs probably already on your system. This is what actually grabs the packets.\nWireshark - A GUI tool for visualizing packets, because tcpdump doesn‚Äôt have any GUI. There is also command-line version which is called tshark.\nPython + Scapy - For programmatic analysis (we‚Äôll get to this).\nWe need elevated permissions to capture packets, which is understandable. Intercepting network traffic is sensitive, hence you need to either run with sudo or have the proper capabilities set.\n# Install what you need # sudo apt-get install tcpdump wireshark python3-pip pip install scapy How do I capture my own traffic? First, let‚Äôs find our network interface:\nip link show # or ifconfig We will see something like eth0, wlan0, or enp0s3. That‚Äôs the interface.\nNow let‚Äôs capture some traffic:\nsudo tcpdump -i enp0s3 -w my_capture.pcap # -i specifies the interface # -w specifies the file to write (pcap data) to This starts capturing everything on enp0s3 and writes it to my_capture.pcap.\nGenerating interesting traffic: Open another terminal and do some normal internet things:\n# Make some DNS queries nslookup google.com # Browse a website curl http://google.com # Ping something ping -c 5 google.com After 30 seconds or so, stop tcpdump with Ctrl+C. And just like this, we captured our first PCAP. Nice.\nTip We can make use of filters to avoid capturing everything:\n# Only capture HTTP traffic sudo tcpdump -i enp0s3 -w http_only.pcap 'port 80' # Capture traffic to/from a specific IP sudo tcpdump -i enp0s3 -w target.pcap 'host 8.8.8.8' Analyse PCAP with Python and Scapy The packet has various fields and I am interested in the following:\nSource/Destination IP - Who‚Äôs talking to whom? Source/Destination Port - What service? (80=HTTP, 443=HTTPS, 22=SSH) Protocol - TCP, UDP, ICMP? Flags (for TCP) - SYN, ACK, FIN - these tell us about connection state Payload - The actual data being transmitted Reading a PCAP file\nfrom scapy.all import * # Load the PCAP packets = rdpcap('my_capture.pcap') print(f\"Total packets: {len(packets)}\") # Look at the first packet # first_packet = packets[0] # first_packet.show() # Look at the packet's flag # And it is a good idea to check if there is a 'TCP' or any layer # first_packet_flag = first_packet[TCP].flags # print(f\"This is the flag : {first_packet_flag}\") # Get all IPs ip_addresses = set() for packet in packets: if packet.haslayer(IP): # add source and destination to the set --\u003e ensures no duplicates ip_addresses.add(packet[IP].src) ip_addresses.add(packet[IP].dst) print(\"IP addresses involved: \", ip_addresses) # {'34.107.221.82', '142.250.179.206', '10.0.2.15'} # Finding HTTP requests for packet in packets: if packet.haslayer(TCP) and packet.haslayer(Raw): payload = packet[Raw].load # HTTP requests start with methods like GET, POST if payload.startswith(b'GET') or payload.startswith(b'POST'): print(payload.decode('utf-8', errors='ignore')) Dataset Tools like Wireshark and tcpdump allow us to intercept data from a network interface, which is then stored as pcap files. Since, generating real-world-like network traffic (on our own) is not trivial, there are free, publicly available capture files which I will use: Netresec 1\nDetails Work in progress.
