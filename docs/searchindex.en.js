The following is a nice definition1.\nDetails Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) is an essential tool that collects, stores, and performs log management and analyzes extensive volumes of log data from across an organizationâ€™s network, generating security alerts when needed.\nEvery SIEM does five fundamental things:\nData collection and Normalization Storage and Indexing Detection and Analysis Response and Orchestration Intelligence and Visualization With the above tools/capabilities, security teams can assess, triage and respond to security events.\nI do not want to re-invent the wheel, but rather have insights into the components that make up SIEM.\nLLMs and AI agents will be useful in extending capabilities of such a SIEM, though the first goal is to work out the basics.\nDetails Dezible is work in progress.\nFound it interesting?
