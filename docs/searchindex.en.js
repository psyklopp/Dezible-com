So I will generate some of my own.\nLinux has a command-line utility called tcpdump.\nGot it! Let me draft sections 1-5 with that learning-together tone. I‚Äôll keep the early sections concise and build up to the meatier Python stuff.\nCapturing and Analyzing Network Traffic: A Hands-On Journey with PCAP Files If you‚Äôre getting into cybersecurity or incident response, you‚Äôll inevitably hear: ‚ÄúCheck the packet capture.‚Äù But what does that actually mean? Let me walk you through what I learned about capturing and analyzing network traffic using PCAP files.\nWhat is a PCAP file and why should I care? PCAP stands for Packet Capture - it‚Äôs basically a recording of everything that happened on a network. Think of it like a black box recorder for network traffic.\nWhen I first heard about PCAPs, I wondered why they matter. Here‚Äôs the thing: when something suspicious happens on a network - maybe at 2 AM when no one‚Äôs supposed to be working - the PCAP file is your ground truth. It shows exactly what data moved where, who talked to whom, and what protocols were used.\nFor security work, PCAPs are essential for:\nIncident response - reconstructing what an attacker actually did Threat hunting - looking for suspicious patterns in normal traffic Forensics - having evidence of what occurred Understanding attacks - seeing how exploits work at the network level What tools do I need to capture network traffic? On Linux, you need just a few tools to get started:\ntcpdump - The command-line packet capture tool. It‚Äôs probably already on your system. This is what actually grabs the packets.\nWireshark - A GUI tool for visualizing packets. Great for when you want to see what‚Äôs happening. The command-line version is called tshark.\nPython + Scapy - For programmatic analysis (we‚Äôll get to this).\nOne important thing I learned: you need elevated permissions to capture packets. Your user needs to either run with sudo or have the proper capabilities set. This makes sense - you‚Äôre intercepting all network traffic, which is sensitive.\n# Install what you need sudo apt-get install tcpdump wireshark python3-pip pip install scapy How do I capture my own traffic? Here‚Äôs where it got real for me. Let‚Äôs actually capture some packets.\nFirst, find your network interface:\nip link show # or ifconfig You‚Äôll see something like eth0, wlan0, or enp0s3. That‚Äôs your interface.\nNow let‚Äôs capture some traffic:\nsudo tcpdump -i eth0 -w my_capture.pcap This starts capturing everything on eth0 and writes it to my_capture.pcap.\nGenerating interesting traffic: Open another terminal and do some normal internet things:\n# Make some DNS queries nslookup google.com # Browse a website curl http://example.com # Ping something ping -c 5 google.com After 30 seconds or so, stop tcpdump with Ctrl+C. Congratulations - you just captured your first PCAP!\nPro tip I learned: Use capture filters to avoid drowning in data:\n# Only capture HTTP traffic sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -w http_only.pcap 'port 80' # Capture traffic to/from a specific IP sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -w target.pcap 'host 8.8.8.8' Dataset Tools like Wireshark and tcpdump allow us to intercept data from a network interface, which is then stored as pcap files. Since, generating real-world-like network traffic (on our own) is not trivial, there are free, publicly available capture files which I will use: Netresec 1\nDetails Work in progress.\nhttps://www.netresec.com/?page=PcapFiles¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é",
