Cybersecurity is very broad indeed. Are there any frameworks or standard guidelines ? NIST is the National Institute of Standards and Technology at the U.S. Department of Commerce. NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) offers a taxonomy of highlevel cybersecurity outcomes that can be used by any organization — regardless of its size, sector, or maturity — to better understand, assess, prioritize, and communicate its cybersecurity efforts. 1.\nNote: CSF is a recommendation and the framework is voluntary.\nResources You can put the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to work in your business in these five areas: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.\nSee how would you implement this for your company.
