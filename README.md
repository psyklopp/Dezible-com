# Dezible-com

Dezible is a project where I will try to post high-quality articles about some topics I like. The primary ones being Cybersecurity and Flutter. I want to learn both of them because the former is the specialization that I am studying and the latter will help me to bring some of my ideas to life.

It will be (a little bit) cumbersome to post about them parallelly. None the less, I will try to do it and learn about these topics gradually with bite-sized information.

Easier said than done but this is a start. I am also interested in Quantum and Post-Quantum Cryptography.

Let's see how this goes.
