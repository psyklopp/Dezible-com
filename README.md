# Dezible - A graph-native AI assistant for incident response

ü§ñ A functional SIEM system teaches you how modern security platforms work. Not a toy, not enterprise-grade but something in between that actually works and teaches real concepts. It is a crucial tool in incident response, so why not make it?

### üîñ Core Philosophy

- Start with working simple systems (Gall's Law)
- Build components that can be extended
- Learn by doing, not by reading vendor docs
- ML and automation as first-class citizens, not afterthoughts

### üèÄ The Five Pillars

Every SIEM (though it can vary) does five fundamental things:

1. Data Collection & Normalization - Gather security data from everywhere
2. Storage & Indexing - Store billions of events, search in milliseconds
3. Detection & Analysis - Find threats in the noise
4. Response & Orchestration - Act on threats automatically
5. Intelligence & Visualization - Present the story to analysts

Each pillar gets its own chapter in Dezible. Each chapter builds a working component.
