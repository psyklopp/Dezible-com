üìë Dezible is a project where I will try to post my learnings, findings and code samples in the field of eXplainable AI (XAI). [Homepage - Dezible](https://www.dezible.com/)

As a community we aim to develop and improve XAI to meet the needs and expectations of end-users. But the question arises, how is it even possible if they are not a part of evaluation?

<summary><h3>What the hell is XAI‚ùì</h3></summary>
XAI is a subfield of AI that deals with making machine learning models explainable to users. This includes techniques such as model interpretability and providing clear, understandable reasons for decisions made by algorithms.

<summary><h3> Why should you care about XAI‚ùì</h3></summary>

With XAI, the goal is to get insights into why AI systems make particular decisions or predictions. We can list out some points that describe its significance.

1. **Enhancing Model Trustworthiness**: XAI provides transparency into the reasoning behind AI outputs, increasing confidence in their reliability.

2. **Debugging & Refining AI Systems**: Identifying where an AI goes wrong allows for targeted improvements. Understanding error causes facilitates adjusting training data or altering the model's structure to reduce mistakes.

3. **Improved Decision Making**: XAI enables users to understand and validate AI-driven decisions, making informed choices when relying on AI outputs or in integrating those outputs into human decision-making processes.

4. F**acilitating Model Interpretability**: Beyond just predictions, XAI helps dissect how features contribute to outcomes across different types of models, from deep learning networks to more interpretable models like linear regression.

5. **Supporting Regulatory Compliance & Legal Standards**: As AI systems permeate more critical societal domains, regulatory frameworks increasingly require their transparency and explainability, especially in healthcare, finance, or autonomous vehicles.

6. **Boosting User Engagement & Satisfaction**: When individuals understand how an AI works, they're more likely to interact with it positively. Clear explanations enhance user experience by demystifying AI actions.
