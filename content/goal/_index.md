And why do I want to talk about this topic?

My name is Aditya Bhardwaj and am currently a PhD candidate at University of Twente - you can find me here through [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ab4dev/)

I am deeply interested in following the progress in the area of **XAI**, specially in the methods of evaluating such XAI models. 

And as I am starting to go through academic research for my PhD, I realized that there is a lack of systemized knowledge on XAI. There might a lot of resources on this topic, but are present sparsely.

:bulb: The goal is to collect and organize the literature, with a focus on practical adoption of XAI and the challenges it faces. I will also focus on implementing such methods and sharing it as open-source code.
