Welcome to Dezible, where I will share my findings on the topic of `Explainable AI`

And who am I?

And why do I want to talk about this topic?

My name is Aditya Bhardwaj and am currently a PhD candidate at University of Twente - you can find me here through [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ab4dev/)

I am deeply interested in following the progress in the area of **XAI** (yes, that is the term for eXplainable AI), specially in the methods of evaluating such XAI models.

### What is the goal?

As I am starting to go through academic research for my PhD, I realized that there is a lack of systemized knowledge on XAI. There might a lot of resources on this topic, but are present sparsely.

The goal is to collect and organize the literature, with a focus on practical adoption of XAI and the challenges it faces. I will also focus on implementing such methods and sharing it as open-source code.

### Next steps

I will take a systematic approach where I update this site as I learn more. The aim is to share and cite the relevant research papers along with the code.
