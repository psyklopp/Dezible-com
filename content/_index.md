Hello! My name is Aditya Bhardwaj.

I passed out in July 2024 with an MSc. degree in Cybersecurity.

#### I have a goal - *to just stick to it.*

While I learned a lot of things in my studies, I didn't focus on the real-world tools.

This is a common issue. Often termed as 'skill gap'.

#### It is hard to focus - *and there is lot to learn*.

Cybersecurity is a very broad field. Broader than what people might imagine.

There is a lot of data/information out there.

It takes time to transform that to knowledge.

### Sharing your learning progress can be an effective way to do it.

My goal is to document and share my progress.

Hopefully it helps you.

### What is next ?

**Refer to the left sidebar.**

Soon, I will start adding content. Relevant headings and categories will be used.

For now - Fundamentals.
