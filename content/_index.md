There is a lot of data out there. And it is the process of analyzing data, that gives us knowledge.

Machines can churn out information from data but I believe humans (for the time being) can turn the same into knowledge with a lot more interesting insights.


## Motivation

I got the idea of Dezible from the word '**decibel**'. The decibel (dB) is a logarithmic unit used to measure sound level. It is also widely used in electronics, signals and communication.


## Goal

> Are you a decision maker, researcher, security professional or enthusiast?

Dezible will provide insights and intelligence from the current academic research in cybersecurity. The primary way will be reports which will be published alongside relevant slides and presentations.
