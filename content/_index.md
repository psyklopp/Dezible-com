Welcome to Dezible.

Read the interesting experiment below or check out the basics of XAI starting [here](/basics/).

### Experiment

In 2018, hundreds of top computer scientists, financial engineers, and executives - were asked to engage in a thought experiment where they had cancer and needed surgery to remove a tumor.

Two images were displayed on the screen. 

{{% expand title="First image" %}}

Human surgeon, who could explain anything about the surgery, but had a 15% chance of causing death during the surgery. 

{{% /expand %}}

{{% expand title="Second image" %}}

Robotic arm that could perform the surgery with only a 2% chance of failure. 

{{% /expand %}}

The audience was then asked to raise a hand to vote for which of the two they would prefer to perform life-saving surgery. 

All but one hand voted for the robot.

{{% notice style="accent" %}}
It is obvious that a 2% chance of mortality is better than a 15% chance of mortality.
{{% /notice %}}

Humans are too inhibited to adopt techniques which are not interpretable, traceable or trustworthy.

So, why must the robot be a black box?

And would people trust a robotic-hand? If the AI system could converse or maybe explain itself (better).
