NIST is the National Institute of Standards and Technology at the U.S. Department of Commerce. NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) offers a taxonomy of highlevel cybersecurity outcomes that can be used by any organization — regardless of its size, sector, or maturity — to better understand, assess, prioritize, and communicate its cybersecurity efforts. [^csf]. 

Note: CSF is a recommendation and the framework is voluntary.

You can put the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to work in your business in these five areas: **Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover**.

- See [how would you implement this](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cybersecurity-framework/filters#/csf/filters) for your company.
- [Other publications](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/) by NIST.
