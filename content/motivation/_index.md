My name is Aditya Bhardwaj and am currently a PhD candidate at University of Twente - you can find me here through [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ab4dev/)

As the area of AI progresses, a number of people are sharing tutorials (about agents, LLMs and whatnot). Often times, these are singular projects which end up with others in project graveyard.

I want to change that.

My aim is to stick to some projects and build them incrementally. This way, I get to learn and apply new concepts.

In this regard, I also like to share Gall's law. Though the following statement might not be stated verbatim by the author in his work, I fully agree with the idea that...  

> A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system.

Taking inspiration from these words, I plan to start simple in every project.

And then improve them. Let's go!
