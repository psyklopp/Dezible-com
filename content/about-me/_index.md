:wave: My name is Aditya Bhardwaj. 

I passed out in July 2024 with an MSc. degree in Cybersecurity. :books:

#### I have a goal - *to build real-life skills in cybersecurity*


While I learned a lot of things in my studies, I didn't focus on the real-world tools.

I want to build an open-access knowledge base for learning **Security Operation Center (SOC)** skills.
