Packet Capture or **PCAP** files record the raw data packets. You can use tools like Wireshark and tcpdump to intercept data from a network interface, which are then stored as `pcap` files.

With the network activity stored in these files, we can investigate and anaylze traffic at the packet level.

### Sample PCAP files

We can generate our own traffic, but there are free, publicly available `pcap` files like here: [Netresec](https://www.netresec.com/?page=PcapFiles) [^1]
