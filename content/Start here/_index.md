All the sections on the left-hand side contain material related to that particular certification/course.

The aim of this website is to create or curate articles for a specific certification. There is no dearth of good resources online, but it is preferable to study with a goal in mind.

For example, I will start collecting resources based on the syllabus for [Security Blue Team Level 1 certification](https://dezible.com/security-blue-team-level-1/index.html).

This helps me too, as I am studying for the same.
